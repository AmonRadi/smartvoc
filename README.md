SmartVoc is a program designed for self-study of languages and memorizing new words. 
You can create custom dictionaries dedicated to the topics you're studying, 
add related words along with their translations, and then test how well you've learned them.

How to Use:
    Create a New Dictionary
        Choose a theme for the words you want to learn.
        Enter '1' in the main menu, and give your new dictionary a name. For example, "Transport."

    Populate Your Dictionary
        Enter '2' in the main menu and select the desired dictionary by entering its name.
        Record a new word in the language you're learning (e.g., 'автівка') and then write its translation in your native language (e.g., 'a car').
        Add several words (5+) for an engaging testing experience.

    Test Your Knowledge!
        Enter '3' in the main menu and choose the relevant dictionary by entering its name.
        You can test your knowledge of the entire dictionary or select a specific number of random words.
        The program will present random words from the dictionary, and your task is to recall and type their translations in your native language.
        At the end of the test, you'll see your score along with any errors you made.

You can create as many dictionaries as you like and add as many words as needed.

Enjoy Learning!

This is my first pet project, created for practical learning of both Python and English (my native language is Ukrainian).
I would greatly appreciate any feedback, code reviews, or recommendations.
